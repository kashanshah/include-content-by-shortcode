== Description ==
This plugin allows the user to add single content in multiple posts and pages by means of a shortcode. It is used to fulfill the concept of PHP's 'include' function. 
For example, my brand's tagline, "The Best Of Its Kind" set to be used on various pages and posts, I would add that in Included Content and it will generate a shortcode against this content. This generated shortcode will now be placed everywhere I want to add my tagline. 
 Now in future, if I would change my tagline, I would need to change it only in Included Content and it will change it everywhere the shortcode was used.

== Installation ==
1. Upload "include-content-by-shortcode" to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.

== Screenshots ==
1. Add a content
2. Copy the shortcode generated for that content
3. Paste the shortcode in any post or page
3. The included content will appear where the shortcode would be pasted
